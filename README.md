## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing global company, recently suffered a significant loss after expanding into the American market based on intuition and limited Excel-based analysis. To prevent such missteps in the future and remain competitive, the company decided to build a robust data analytics infrastructure using Power BI.

The goal of this project is to empower different departmentsâ€”Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chainâ€”with interactive dashboards that enable data-driven decision-making.

## Key DAX Measures

* `Total Net Sales = [Gross Sales] - [Pre Invoice Deductions] - [Post Invoice Deductions]`
* `Gross Margin % = DIVIDE([Net Sales] - [COGS], [Net Sales])`
* `Forecast Accuracy % = DIVIDE([Forecast Qty] - [Actual Qty], [Forecast Qty])`
* `YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Net Sales], 'Date'[Date])`
* `Top Product by Market = RANKX(ALL('Product'), [Net Sales])`

---

## Project Outcome

With this dashboard:

* Executives get an overview of performance across departments
* Finance can track profitability and margins
* Marketing can identify top-performing regions and platforms
* Supply chain teams can evaluate forecast accuracy vs actuals
* Sales can monitor monthly and yearly growth

This project empowered AtliQ Hardware to base their decisions on actual data, reducing risk and improving efficiency across the organization.
